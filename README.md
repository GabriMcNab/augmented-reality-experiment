# augmented-reality-experiment
Here's the link of the live example: https://augmented-reality-experiment.herokuapp.com/

Note: I've included an example of a ticket in this project (example-voucher.png), so you can try the functionality.
You just need to open the app on your mobile device and point the camera to the example voucher.
